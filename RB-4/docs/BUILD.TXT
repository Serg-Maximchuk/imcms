Building imCMS:


Prerequisites:

    * Install the Java Development Kit version 1.5 or later.

    * Install Apache Ant 1.6.2 or later.

    * Make sure that junit is available in ant's classpath,
      for example by putting a junit jar file in $ANT_HOME/lib.
      
      If you cannot do this, you can disable tests by setting the property
      "no-junit-task-available" in "build.properties".

      JUnit cannot be distributed with imCMS due to licensing issues.
      

Building:

    * Copy "build.properties.template" to "build.properties"
      (if "build.properties" does not already exist).
      Edit "build.properties" and insert the proper values
      for your deployroot, your database connection,
      your imCMS-preferences, and your build-preferences.

    * Run "ant dist" (or just "ant", since "dist" is the default) in this directory.
      This will build imCMS in the "build"-directory
      and generate a file named "imcms.war" in the "dist" directory.
      This will also generate sql-scripts in the "build/WEB-INF/sql"-directory.

      (For more possible ant-targets, run "ant -projecthelp".)


Installing with Ant:

    * If you inserted a value for "deployroot" in "build.properties", you may have ant install the war-file for you.

      A. If you inserted a value for "deployroot", run "ant warinstall" to have ant install the war-file for you.
         You may also instead run "ant install" to copy the webapp directory directly without making a war-file.

      B. If you didn't insert a value for "deployroot", copy the war-file manually to the webapp-deployment directory
         for your servlet engine. (For Tomcat, "webapps".)
