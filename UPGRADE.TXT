Upgrading imCMS:

* If you have a version of imCMS older than 1.7.5,
  you must delete any documents of the types "diagram" (101) or "calendar" (107),
  They are no longer supported. The diff scripts will fail if this is not done.

* Stop tomcat.

* Backup the imCMS database.

* Backup the imCMS webapp directory ("tomcat/webapps/imcms")

* Remove the imCMS webapp directory from tomcat/webapps.

* Remove the old "imcms.war" file from tomcat/webapps.

* Install the new imCMS version according to "Installing imCMS" and
  "Setting up imCMS" in file "INSTALL.TXT".

* Run the sql diff scripts appropriate for your versions on the database.
  They can be found in the directory "tomcat/webapps/imcms/WEB-INF/sql/diff".
  For example, if you have version 1.8.3 installed and
  want to upgrade to 1.9.0, you'll need to run the scripts "diff-1.8.3-1.8.4.sql" and "diff-1.8.4-1.9.0.sql".

* Run the stored procedures sql script "tomcat/webapps/WEB-INF/sql/imcms-sprocs-<version>.sql" on the database.

* Restore all user files and directories from the backup. You'll need to look at at least these directories:
    - /css
    - /images
    - /javascript
    - /jsp
    - /user
    - /WEB-INF/fortunes
    - /WEB-INF/includes
    - /WEB-INF/logs ( new log files will be created, restore only access.log files used to generate statistics )
    - /WEB-INF/templates/text
    - /WEB-INF/uploads

* Restart tomcat.


You're done!
