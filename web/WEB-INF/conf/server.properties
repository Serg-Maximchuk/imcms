# See for example http://www.cio.ufl.edu/projects/directory/ldap-schema/oc-INETORGPERSON.html

# You can define your own attribute mappings with "LdapUserAttribute.<xxx> = ldap-attribute",
# where <xxx> is one of LoginName, FirstName, LastName, Title, Company, Address, City, Zip, Country, CountyCouncil,

# This demonstrates using the two Active Directory attributes, "company" and "co" (country):
LdapUserAttribute.Company = company
LdapUserAttribute.Country = co

# By default, 'uid' is the user-identifying attribute.
# For MS Active Directory which uses 'sAMAccountName', uncomment the following line.
