Installing imCMS:


Prerequisites:
    * Install the Java Development Kit version 1.4 or later.

    * Install Apache Tomcat 4 or later,
      or another servlet-api 2.3 (or later) compatible servlet engine.

    * Install Microsoft SQL Server 2000.

    * Download the Microsoft JDBC driver for SQL Server 2000 Service Pack 2 or later
      from http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/


Building:
    * If you want to build imCMS from source, see the file BUILD.TXT.
      If you don't know what this means, you don't need to.


Installing imCMS:
    * Rename the file "imcms-<version>.war" to "imcms.war",
      and install it in the "tomcat/webapps" directory.

    * Start Tomcat.
      Tomcat will find the war-file you installed, and unpack it into a directory named after the war-file.

    * Copy the JDBC jar-files (3 files) from the /lib directory where you have unpacked the JDBC driver
      to directory "tomcat/webapps/imcms/WEB-INF/lib".


Setting up the database:
    * Create a new empty database with your preferred collation.
      We use the collation "Finnish_Swedish_CI_AS".
      This can be done with the SQL statement

          CREATE DATABASE [<databasename>] COLLATE Finnish_Swedish_CI_AS

      where <databasename> is the name you want for your database.
      See "tomcat/webapps/imcms/WEB-INF/sql/create_db-<version>.sql" for a simple script to use.

    * To set up the imCMS-database run the sql script
      "tomcat/webapps/imcms/WEB-INF/sql/imcms-<version>.sql" on the empty database.


Setting up imCMS:
    * Edit the file "server.properties" in the directory "tomcat/webapps/imcms/WEB-INF/conf",
      and set the database parameters ("JdbcDriver", "JdbcUrl", "User", "Password", "MaxConnectionCount")
      according to your setup.
      If using Microsofts JDBC-driver, note that it will "clone" connections past the MaxConnectionCount
      unless property "SelectMethod=cursor" is set in the JdbcUrl.
      Set "SmtpServer" to the hostname of your SMTP (outgoing mail) server.

    * Restart Tomcat to reload the settings.


Running:
    * Try logging in at " http://localhost:8080/imcms/login/ " as user "admin" with password "admin".
      (Replace "localhost:8080" with whatever hostname and port your servlet engine is running on.)


You're done!
