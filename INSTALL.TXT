Building and install imCMS:


Prerequisites:
    1. Install Java Development Kit 1.3 or later.

    2. Install Apache Tomcat,
       or another servlet-api 2.2 (or later) compatible servlet engine.

    3. Install Apache Ant.

    4. Create an empty database.


Building:
    5. Copy "build.properties.template" to "build.properties".
       Edit "build.properties" and insert the proper values 
       for your deployroot, your database connection,
       your imCMS-preferences, and your build-preferences.

    6. Run "ant dist" (or just "ant", since "dist" is the default) in this directory.
       This will build imCMS in the "build"-directory
       and generate a file named "imcms.war" in this directory.

       This will also generate files named "imcms.sql" and "help.sql in this directory.
       To create an default imCMS-database, first run "imcms.sql" on the empty database
	 and then run "help.sql" on same database.

    (For more possible ant-targets, run "ant -projecthelp".)


Installing:
    7. If you inserted a value for "deployroot" in "build.properties", do A, otherwise do B.

	A. Run "ant install-war" to have ant install the war-file for you.

	B. Copy the war-file manually to the webapp-deployment directory
	   for your servlet engine. (For Tomcat, "webapps".)


        (Advanced: If you inserted a value for "deployroot"
	  you may also use "ant install".
          This will skip the war-file
	  and copy the "build"-directory directly.
          This way no unpacking of the war-file is needed.)


Running:
    8. Start your servlet engine.
       The servlet engine will find the war-file you installed, and unpack it.
       Try logging in at " http://localhost:8080/imcms/login/ ".
       (Replace "localhost:8080" with whatever hostname and port your servlet engine is running on.)


You're done!
