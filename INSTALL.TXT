Install imCMS:


Prerequisites:
    * Install the Java Development Kit version 1.4 or later.

    * Install Apache Tomcat 4+,
      or another servlet-api 2.3 (or later) compatible servlet engine.

    * Install Microsoft SQL Server 2000.

    * Download the Microsoft JDBC driver for SQL Server 2000 Service Pack 2 or later from www.microsoft.com.


Building:
    * If you want to build imCMS from source, see the file BUILD.TXT.
      If you don't know what this means, you don't need to.


Setting up the database:
    * Create a new empty database with collation "Finnish_Swedish_CI_AS".
      This can be done with the SQL statement
          "CREATE DATABASE [<databasename>] COLLATE Finnish_Swedish_CI_AS",
      where <databasename> is the name you want for your database. See create_db.sql for
      a simple script to use.

    * To set up the imCMS-database run "imcms.sql" on the empty database.


Installing imCMS:
    * Install the file "imcms.war" in the "tomcat/webapps" directory.
      If the war-file isn't named "imcms.war", rename it first,
      or it will be unpacked in a directory named after the file,
      and internal references to the url-path "/imcms" will not work.

    * Copy the JDBC files (3 files) from the /lib directory where you have unpacked the JDBC driver
    	to directory "tomcat/webapps/imcms/WEB_INF/lib". 	

    * Start Tomcat.
      The servlet engine will find the war-file you installed, and unpack it.


Setting up imCMS:
    * Edit the file "server.properties" in the directory "tomcat/webapps/imcms/WEB-INF/conf",
      and set the database parameters (JdbcDriver, JdbcUrl, User, Password, MaxConnectionCount) according to your setup.
      If using Microsofts JDBC-driver, note that it will "clone" connections past the MaxConnectionCount
      unless property "SelectMethod=cursor" is set in the JdbcUrl.

    * Edit the file "host.properties" in the same directory,
      and set "smtp_server" to the hostname of your SMTP (outgoing mail) server.

    * Restart Tomcat to reload the settings.


Running:
      Try logging in at " http://localhost:8080/imcms/login/ " as user "admin" with password "admin".
      (Replace "localhost:8080" with whatever hostname and port your servlet engine is running on.)


You're done!
