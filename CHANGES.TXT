Version 1.9.0:

= Of interest to users:

* Simple/advanced view toggle for docinfo.
* Admin-pages will now work on non-javascript-enabled browsers.
* All admin-pages now use the new blue/white look.
* The link checker will now also check linked images and urls in text-fields.
* "Administer conferences" functionality moved to "List new/updated pages".
* The session counter now counts sessions, not logins.
  This means that each visitor is only counted once per browser session,
  instead of once when entering the site and then again when logging in.

= Of interest to template creators:

* New template tag: <?imcms:contextpath?> will be replaced by the "context path" of the webapp.
  The context path is the root path to the webapp, usually the name of the webapp preceded by a slash,
  for example "/imcms". This is useful when one wants to construct an absolute URL.
  Example: <img src="<?imcms:contextpath?>/images/imCMSpower.gif" alt="Powered by imCMS">

= Of interest to administrators:

* The webapp should now be possible to rename without having to change any templates.
* We now return correct HTTP status codes: 404 for "Not found", and 403 for "Forbidden/Permission denied".
* Changed database parameters to allow for different database-drivers:
  The parameters "Url", "Host", "Port", "DatabaseName" in imcms/WEB-INF/conf/server.properties were replaced
  by the single option "JdbcUrl",  which for the Microsoft JDBC driver maps to the old parameters as follows:
  jdbc:microsoft:sqlserver://<Host>:<Port>;DatabaseName=<DatabaseName>
* The "MaxConnectionCount" in server.properties is ignored by the Microsoft JDBC Driver, unless one sets
  the driver parameter "SelectMethod" to "cursor".
  To do this, append ";SelectMethod=cursor" (note the semicolon) to the JdbcUrl.
  The default is "SelectMethod=direct", and this causes the MS JDBC driver to clone connections internally.
  See http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;313220 for more information.
* Conference, billboard, and chat should now work on case sensitive filesystems, for example on linux.
* Reindexing of documents is now scheduled every 24 hours from startup. Reindexing is done to
  a new directory, "imcms/WEB-INF/index.new",  which replaces the current index "imcms/WEB-INF/index" when complete.

= Of interest to API-using developers:

* Moved the apisamples from "/apisamples/" to "/imcms/docs/apisamples/".
* DocumentService.saveChanges(Document) is now synchronized as a poor mans transaction to prevent database conflicts.
* Added method DocumentService.getCategoryType(int categoryTypeId)
* Added method DocumentService.createNewCategoryType(String name, int maxChoices)
* Added method DocumentService.createNewCategory(String name, String description, String imageUrl, CategoryType categoryType)
* Added method TemplateService.getAllTemplateGroups()
* Added accessors Template.getId() and TemplateGroup.getId().
* Added convenience method DocumentService.parseLuceneSearchQuery(String) which returns a SearchQuery parsed according
  to Lucene syntax, see http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/queryparsersyntax.html

= Of interest to developers:

* Cleaned up the file organization in the project.
* Renamed all the ant-targets using more consistent names.
* The API now has its own connection pool,
  so developers using the API can't accidentally starve the system of connections.
* Jakarta Velocity (http://jakarta.apache.org/velocity/) can now be used in admintemplates and JSP-pages.
* Searchable tokens in the index may now only consist of letters, digits, and underscores, instead of non-whitespace.
  This makes html index a little bit better, so that for example <b>bold</b> is indexed as two words ("b" and "bold").
* There's a new test for checking which language properties are in use,
  run with the ant target "check-language-properties-in-use".
