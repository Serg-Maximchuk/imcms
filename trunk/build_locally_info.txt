
Please add information about how to set this up locally.

It would be nice to have an pom.xml in the main-branch as well, so one could generate IDEA-projects.

Need info about:

- How to set up the DB in my local MySql.
- How to configure the IDEA-proj.
- How to configure the build.properties to work with http://localhost:8080/imcms
