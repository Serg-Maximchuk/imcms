Installing imCMS:


Prerequisites:

    * Install the Java Development Kit version 1.4 or later.

    * Install Apache Tomcat 4 or later,
      or another servlet-api 2.3 (or later) compatible servlet engine.

    * Install Microsoft SQL Server 2000, or MySQL 4.1 or later.


Building:

    * If you want to build imCMS from source, see the file BUILD.TXT.
      If you don't know what this means, you don't need to.


Installing imCMS:

    * Rename the file "imcms-<version>.war" to "imcms.war",
      and install it in the "tomcat/webapps" directory.

    * Start Tomcat.
      Tomcat will find the war-file you installed, and unpack it into a directory named after the war-file.


Setting up the database:

    * Create a new database on your database server and run one of the sql scripts in
      "tomcat/webapps/imcms/WEB-INF/sql/", as appropriate for your type of database server
      and your preferred default language.

      For details with setting up a Microsoft SQL Server database, see the file INSTALL_MSSQL.TXT.

    Example:

        On MySQL something like the following might be appropriate:

            mysql -u <user> -p -e "create database imcms"
            mysql -u <user> -p imcms < imcms-<version>-<language>-mysql.sql
           
        See the MySQL documentation for details.
  

Setting up imCMS:

    * Edit the file "server.properties" in the directory "tomcat/webapps/imcms/WEB-INF/conf",
      and set the database parameters ("JdbcDriver", "JdbcUrl", "User", "Password", "MaxConnectionCount")
      according to your setup.
      Set "SmtpServer" to the hostname of your SMTP (outgoing mail) server.

    * If you want to add a file-extension to be recognized as a mime-type by imCMS,
      add a "<mime-mapping>" to "tomcat/webapps/imcms/WEB-INF/web.xml".
      See http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/ for the mime-type registry.

    * Restart Tomcat to reload the settings.


Running:

    * Try logging in at " http://localhost:8080/imcms/login/ " as user "admin" with password "admin".
      (Replace "localhost:8080" with whatever hostname and port your servlet engine is running on.)


You're done!
