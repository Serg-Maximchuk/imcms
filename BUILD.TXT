Building imCMS:


Prerequisites:
    * Install the Java Development Kit version 1.4 or later.

    * Install Apache Ant 1.6 or later.


Building:
    * Copy "build.properties.template" to "build.properties".
      Edit "build.properties" and insert the proper values
      for your deployroot, your database connection,
      your imCMS-preferences, and your build-preferences.

    * Run "ant dist" (or just "ant", since "dist" is the default) in this directory.
      This will build imCMS in the "build"-directory
      and generate a file named "imcms.war" in the "dist" directory.
      This will also generate sql-scripts in the "build/WEB-INF/sql"-directory.

      (For more possible ant-targets, run "ant -projecthelp".)


Installing with Ant:
    * If you inserted a value for "deployroot" in "build.properties", you may have ant install the war-file for you.

      A. If you inserted a value for "deployroot", run "ant install-war" to have ant install the war-file for you.
         You may also instead run "ant install" to have ant copy the files directly without making a war-file.

      B. If you didn't insert a value for "deployroot", copy the war-file manually to the webapp-deployment directory
         for your servlet engine. (For Tomcat, "webapps".)
