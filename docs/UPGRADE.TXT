Upgrading imCMS:

* First check CHANGES.HTML to see if there's anything you have to do that is not noted in this file.

* Stop tomcat.

* Backup the imCMS database and the imCMS webapp directory ("tomcat/webapps/imcms")

* Remove the imCMS webapp directory and any corresponding war-file from "tomcat/webapps".

* If you have an imCMS version older than 3.0.0,
  run the sql diff scripts appropriate for your imCMS versions on the database.
  They can be found in the directory "tomcat/webapps/imcms/WEB-INF/sql/diff".
  For example, if you have version 2.2.0 installed and
  want to upgrade to 3.0.0, you'll need to run the script "diff-2-3.sql".
  
  There is no sql diff script from version 3 to 4,
  as the database will be automatically upgraded on startup.

* Install the new imCMS version according to "INSTALL.TXT".

* Restore any files or directories you or your users have added, from the backup.
  You'll probably need to look at at least these directories:
    - /css
    - /images
    - /javascript
    - /jsp
    - /user
    - /WEB-INF/includes
    - /WEB-INF/logs   (new log files will be created, you may restore only log files you need)
    - /WEB-INF/templates/text
    - /WEB-INF/uploads
  Note that this is not an exhaustive list.

* Restart tomcat.

* Make sure you did everything outlined as important in CHANGES.HTML.

* Access "/servlet/RebuildIndex" as superadmin to rebuild the search index.


You're done!
