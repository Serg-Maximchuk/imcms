Installing imCMS:


Prerequisites:

    * Install the Java Development Kit version 1.4 or later.

    * Install Apache Tomcat 4 or later,
      or another servlet-api 2.3 (or later) compatible servlet engine.

    * Install Microsoft SQL Server 2000.


Building:

    * If you want to build imCMS from source, see the file BUILD.TXT.
      If you don't know what this means, you don't need to.


Installing imCMS:

    * Rename the file "imcms-<version>.war" to "imcms.war",
      and install it in the "tomcat/webapps" directory.

    * Start Tomcat.
      Tomcat will find the war-file you installed, and unpack it into a directory named after the war-file.


Setting up the database:

    * Create a new empty database with your preferred collation.
      We use the collation "Finnish_Swedish_CI_AS" for swedish installations.
      This can be done with the SQL statement

          CREATE DATABASE [<databasename>] COLLATE Finnish_Swedish_CI_AS

      where <databasename> is the name you want for your database.
      See "tomcat/webapps/imcms/WEB-INF/sql/create_db-<version>.sql" for a simple script to use.

    * To set up the imCMS-database run the sql script
      run "tomcat/webapps/imcms/WEB-INF/sql/imcms-<version>-<language>.sql" on the empty database,
      where <language> is your preferred default language.

    Note:   To run sql scripts, we recommend that you use the "SQL Query Analyzer" ("isqlw"), included with
            Microsoft SQL Server, or the "osql" utility included with Microsoft Desktop Engine (MSDE).
            To use osql, something like

                osql /S <servername> /d <databasename> /U <login> /P <password> /i <scriptfile>

            should probably work. See Microsoft's documentation for details.

            If you are trying to run a script containing non-ASCII characters, it should be noted that the
            osql utility might corrupt these unless ODBC is configured correctly.
            This isn't much of a problem though. These corrupt characters will just look a little funny,
            and can be fixed manually after installation.
            (To get technical, the script is in "iso-8859-1" encoding,
            but osql reads it as if it was a dos codepage, like "CP850" or "CP437", depending on local setup.)


Setting up imCMS:

    * Edit the file "server.properties" in the directory "tomcat/webapps/imcms/WEB-INF/conf",
      and set the database parameters ("JdbcDriver", "JdbcUrl", "User", "Password", "MaxConnectionCount")
      according to your setup.
      Set "SmtpServer" to the hostname of your SMTP (outgoing mail) server.

    * If you want to add a file-extension to be recognized as a mime-type by imCMS,
      add a "<mime-mapping>" to "tomcat/webapps/imcms/WEB-INF/web.xml".
      See http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/ for the mime-type registry.

    * Restart Tomcat to reload the settings.


Running:

    * Try logging in at " http://localhost:8080/imcms/login/ " as user "admin" with password "admin".
      (Replace "localhost:8080" with whatever hostname and port your servlet engine is running on.)


You're done!
