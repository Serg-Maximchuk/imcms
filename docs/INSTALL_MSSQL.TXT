Setting up the database on Microsoft SQL Server:

    * Create a new empty database with your preferred collation.
      We use the collation "Finnish_Swedish_CI_AS" for swedish installations.
      This can be done with the SQL statement

          CREATE DATABASE [<databasename>] COLLATE Finnish_Swedish_CI_AS

      where <databasename> is the name you want for your database.
      You can also do it using Microsoft Enterprise Manager.


    * To set up the imCMS-database run the sql script
      "tomcat/webapps/imcms/WEB-INF/sql/imcms-<version>-<language>-mssql.sql" on the empty database,
      where <language> is your preferred default language, "swe" (swedish) or "eng" (english).


    Note:   To run sql scripts, we recommend that you use the "SQL Query Analyzer" ("isqlw"), included with
            Microsoft SQL Server, or the "osql" utility included with Microsoft Desktop Engine (MSDE).
            To use osql, something like

                osql /S <servername> /U <login> /P <password> /Q "CREATE DATABASE [imcms] COLLATE Finnish_Swedish_CI_AS"
                osql /S <servername> /U <login> /P <password> /d imcms /i imcms-<version>-swe-mssql.sql 

            should probably work. See Microsoft's documentation for details.

            If you are trying to run a script containing non-ASCII characters, it should be noted that the
            osql utility might corrupt these unless ODBC is configured correctly.
            This isn't much of a problem though. These corrupt characters will just look a little funny,
            and can be fixed manually after installation.
            (To get technical, the script is in "iso-8859-1" encoding,
            but osql reads it as if it was a dos codepage, like "CP850" or "CP437", depending on local setup.)
