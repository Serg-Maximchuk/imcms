The Servlets/Jsp and other ui or "exernal" part should never access the databse directly.
But only through "DomainObjects" or even att a higher lever, the "API".

In every "domain package" ther should be Mappers that has the responsbility to map the domain objekts to and from the
database.

Those mappers hould not make any direct calle either but throu the class "DatabaseAccessor".

It's in the Mappers that the low lever database transactions is handled.
